### Previous Meeting Action Items

  * [...]
  * 165: Further documentation will need to happen with the new Treasurer, or in cooperation with Steph. 
  * 167: ditto
  * 169 - 172: Melissa and Jim  to meet with Steph and continue documenting procedures and best practices. 
  * 180: Much documentation has been done, and we pass the torch to the bold treasurers of the future. 
  * Sounds like Melissa has mostly completed this task
  * Melissa: I'd like to prettify it and add screen shots and things to make the process as easy as possible. Steph has suggested moving to QB online or a similar cloud based system for next year though, so perhaps it won't actually be useful. I didn't know the special events task was on the list, but can certainly figure that out.

* Discuss the Long Term Strategic Planning and Board Transition Documents
  * 173: Doug to post a message to the announce list to invite comment, to form agenda items for a meeting to follow on Thursday, November 23. 
  * 174: Tennessee has volunteered to be deputy membership coordinator, with Melissa, Ben, Tennesee and Doug working on a template for the job. 
    * Resolved to revisit what the board is for, and how to delegate more day to day things
    * Christine van Walraven recommends assigning jobs to teams, ensuring that everyone has a backup, and that new people are trained. 
  * 175: Strategic Planning Document reviewed by the board, and will be posted to the Members list by Melissa for discussion. 
  * 176: Melissa will draft a thing, recording best practices for treasurer
  * 179: Ben and Jim to add notes and edits to the draft.
  * 180: Plan to shore up the strategic plan document and the board transition documents. Melissa, Christine, Ben, and Jim to meet at the lab on June 21 to finalize changes. Melissa to send an announcement inviting members to comment and attend. 
  * 182: Plan to ratify and codify 
  
* Warden report
  * 175: Chris loves meetings, and volunteers to be the new Warden Warden
  * 179: Warden meeting needs to be called for training on the new tool lockouts. 
    * Chris to contact Nick read, Sepehr Ghavam, and Wesley Sak about being wardens
  * 180: Wesley has agreed to be the Mill Warden, and is willing to take on the metal lathe. Still no CNC Router warden. Chris to approach Andew Pys about being CNC warden, and remind wardens about training new members. Chris to remain Warden Warden for now. 
  * 182: Is the Warden Report still a thing? Should we make it a thing?

* Tool Lockouts - Discussion on board list to pursue and prioritize lockouts on tools.
  * 173: Ben and Neil report that they are working on it. Ben has set aside November as his Kwartzlab project month. 
  * 174: Ben currently waiting on parts

  * 179: Ben to work on hooking it up, and will take care of the changeover the weekend of May 19th. 
  * 180: Ongoing, but Ben is on it. 
  * 182: Seems as though Ben is mostly finished with this task

 * New Location possibilities / Lease Plan
  * 179: Josh has proposed a new location, and several board members went and viewed it. The location isn't zoned for blacksmithing, however. 
    * The space definitely has potential, and it's worth trying to negotiate the zoning. 
    * Chris to contact Josh and look for city contacts to start the zoning conversation. 
  * 180: Josh is trying to set up a meeting with the landlord of the potential new space. 

* AGM preparations
  * 179: Still need an agenda, a date, and an election coordinator. Jim T to take point on organizing. 
  * 180: Jim T to follow up about an election coordinator. 
  * 181: Any notes to make while the memory is fresh, so we can refer to them next year?

* Proposed changes to role of President
  * 179: Additional definition and roles proposed for the President, including fundraising and community outreach. 
    * Fundraising needs to be a mandate, but the ability to delegate is important. Does not need to be tied to the president role, but the president may be called on to do outreach for granting or fundraising opportunities. Operational role needed, needs a title.
  * 180: Changes and fundraiser integrated into the Board Transition document. 

* Lease plan
  * 179: Board to meet with Christian, intention still to ask the membership for a mandate to move by the end of 2019. Doug to try and book Christian for the next board meeting to discuss the lease. 
  * 180: Discussion with Christian about the possibilities of moving, and the proposal for a mandate to move at the AGM. the goal is to keep lines of communication open and make sure no one gets left in the lurch. Ben to email Christian with information about the kinds of spaces that we're looking for. He offered to put some feelers out. 
  * 182: Notify Christian of our intent and requirements so he may ‘put feelers out’
     
* Fence Repair plan
  * 179: Fence and wall both need repair. Shaun to reach out to Mike about the fence repair. Done.
  * 180: Mike is working on the fence. The plan is to fix the fence first, then repair the siding. 
  * 182: Project has stalled out due to funding issues
    * How can KLab get this project moving again?
    * Is it better to hire a contractor?
      * Drew: I'll ask Mike if he is still interested and if he can get this done quickly. Alternatively, I've installed fences before and would like/can be the contractor if that is the way the board chooses to go. Obviously, I won't be able to vote on this topic if that is the case. I can get it done this month.

## New Business
* Discuss membership team
  * Mandatory email templates
  * Vetted interviewers
  * Review interview process and narrative 
  
* Discuss space search team
  * Limited time purpose built team?
  * For immediate action

* Discuss plans regarding Kwartzlab's future at 33 Kent
  * We should come out of this discussion with a clear timeline
    * Drew: Given the number of people involved, its more a best case timeline

* Discuss implementation of ‘temporary wardenship’ to enable quick reaction 
  * IE: the fence has burned down, who is ‘fence warden’ ?
  * Wardenship enables official use of accounts, materials and funds to act

* Discuss opening an account with Lowes/HomeDepot for KLab build-out and consumables
  * (toilet paper, brown paper towels, consumables, build out materials etc)
  * Wardens can be authorized to use accounts (built in traceability) 

* Discuss placing warden funds into a publicly accessible spreadsheet for member review and easy warden access
  * Melissa: Thus far the only insight people have is the monthly financial reports and or if they ask me, so something accessible that people could easily check would be great.
  * Melissa: Ben mentioned something about a dashboard once? Possibly in conjunction with the database? Is that a thing we could put there?
  * Can this be automated to update monthly using KLabs accounting software?

* Allocate 2017 surplus (requires a vote)

* Discuss training for BoD on key system

* Discuss consolidating lab documents
